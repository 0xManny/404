                 What is a DAO?
                </summary>

                <span>
                A DAO is a business that is governed by smart contracts instead of people, which allow the business to operate autonomously.

                How is a DAO different from a normal LLC?
                </summary>

                <span>
                A normal LLC is managed by one or more human owners, called ‚Äúmembers‚Äù. These members will make all of the decisions for the business and have the final say on all business matters. A DAO is usually managed by an algorithm, though it can also have human members.

                What is a smart contract?
                </summary>

                <span>
                A smart contract is code that runs ‚Äúon top‚Äù of a blockchain that executes when particular conditions are met. They can make decisions, distribute profits, and carry out other tasks.
